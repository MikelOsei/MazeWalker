Using only one Canvas for your entire UI is possible, but it is essential to consider the consequences.
Unity updates and redraws the Canvas every time one of its elements is updated (such as highlighting a button or moving a slider).
If your Canvas is complex and contains many elements, any runtime change can be costly to your performance.

For that, consider having multiple Canvases for different responsibilities and update styles (for example, keeping frequently animated objects in a separate Canvas from static objects).
To safeguard your hierarchical structure, it is also possible to nest Canvases.
